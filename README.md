🏈 NFL Big Data Bowl 2026 — Motion Prediction

Predicting player movement during the ball-in-air phase using pre-snap tracking data

📌 Overview

This repository contains my work for the NFL Big Data Bowl 2026.
The task:
Given player tracking data before the ball is snapped, predict the future trajectories of a subset of players during the ball-in-air phase.

The project explores multiple modeling paradigms including:

2D positional encodings for spatial awareness

Transformer-based sequence models

Dynamic graph neural networks to capture player-to-player interactions

Hybrid fusion architectures combining sequence + graph reasoning
